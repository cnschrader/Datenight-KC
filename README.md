# Date Night KC

 ## About the application
 Have you ever wanted to plan that perfect date night for your partner, but didn't know where to start? Have you ever spent a lot of time reading article after article, trying to find the best spot in town for your favorite activity? Date Night Kc seeks to solve that problem by planning the date for the user. Simply take a brief survey about your (or your partners) interests, and the app does the rest!
